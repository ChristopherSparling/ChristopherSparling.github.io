                                <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A fairly straightforward program, but one that I actively use
                                and enjoyed making, the Combo Practice Tool generates random sets of combos from
                                pre-defined
                                options that take approximately one round (3 minutes) to execute. The tool calls out
                                the moves comprising the current combo and displays them to the user. The program is
                                highly
                                configurable, allowing you to change round length, the time allotted to each
                                combo,
                                and even add in kicks and switch-kicks at the end of the combo for a more challenging
                                set. For my
                                own training I have added combos developed by my gym's coach, but have excluded these
